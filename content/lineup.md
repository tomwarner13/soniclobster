# LINEUP

### Lead Vocals/Guitar/Synths: Nate

A man of many talents, Nate brings energy and versatility to the band. You'll never see him standing still during a show (or in general). Nate has played an eclectic range of music in his history, including being part of a Taylor Swift cover duo in high school.

### Synth Specialist: Carl

Carl adds many sounds to the band. Some of those sounds include "deep techno riffs", "honky tonk piano", and "electric organ". Legend has it that no one has ever seen him without his sunglasses.

### Drums/Backing Vocals/Loud Noises: Brett

The drummer is literally the beating heart of any band; Brett is the beating heart of Sonic Lobster in a more metaphorical way too. He gathered the other members together in his basement to play music, and the band was born.

### Bass/Guitar/Goofy Dances: Tom

Tom is a classically trained musician (played trombone for one season in the high school marching band) who brings his extensive touring experience (practicing in front of his dog) to Sonic Lobster. He also made this website.
